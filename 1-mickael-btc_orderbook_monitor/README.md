# BITCOIN(BTC) Order Book Monitor

This folder is composed of 3 applications, each as notebooks (*.ipynb) and scripts (*.py), found in their respective folders. They are described in detail below.
crontabs jobs have been set up to run the applications scripts every hour. 

## Application I - "1.2-mick-recording_best_bid_ask"

## Application II - "1.3-mick-recording_lobs"
